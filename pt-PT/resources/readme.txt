To watch a video with subtitles on VLC (videolan.org), ensure the video file and subtitle file are in the same folder and have the exact same name (e.g., video.mp4 and video.srt). Open the video in VLC, and it will automatically load the subtitles. If the subtitles donâ€™t appear, right-click the video screen, go to **Subtitle**, then **Add Subtitle File**, and select the correct .srt file. Enjoy watching with subtitles!
