The model can tell you how **confident** it is about whether it is correct.

--- task ---

+ Go back to the **Learn & Test** page in the training tool.

+ Type something that has nothing to do with lamps or fans into the test box. For example, you could type in 'play some music'.

The **confidence score** is the programâ€™s way of telling you how likely it is that it has labelled the command correctly. 

--- task ---

+ Return to Scratch.

+ Add some new code so that the assistant will tell you it didn't understand the command if the confidence score is less than 70%.

![New Scratch code: If recognise text (answer) confidence < 70, say 'Sorry I didn't understand that' for 2 seconds](images/code-with-confidence.png)
