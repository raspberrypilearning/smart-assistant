## Train your assistant

The classroom has two devices: a fan and a light.

Your assistant needs some examples of the words you might say when you want each device to be turned on or off. For example, to **turn the fan on**, you might say:

+ "Turn on the fan"
+ "Turn the fan on"
+ "Please could you switch on the fan"
+ "I'm too hot"
+ "It's hot in here"
