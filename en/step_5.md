## Use the machine learning model in Scratch

Now update your Scratch program to include your machine learning model instead of a rules-based approach.

--- task ---
+ Click on the **< Back to project** link.

+ Click on **Make**.

+ Click on **Scratch 3**.

+ Read the instructions on the page to learn how to use machine learning blocks in Scratch.

+ Click on **Open in Scratch 3**.

+ Click on **File** and then on **Load from your computer**, and select the Scratch project you saved earlier.

+ When Scratch asks you whether to replace the current project, click on **OK**.

+ Click on the **Code** tab, and update your Scratch code to use your machine learning model **instead** of the rules you first added.

The `recognise text … (label)` block is a new block added by your project. This new block can receive a message and return one of the four labels, based on the machine learning model you have trained.

+ Test your project: type a command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard. The fan or lamp should react to your command.

Make sure you test that this works **even for commands that you didn’t include as examples in the buckets.**

+ Save your project: click on **File** and then on **Save to your computer**.

Now your Scratch smart virtual classroom uses a machine learning model instead of a rules-based approach.

Using machine learning is better than using rules, because training a program to recognise commands for itself is much quicker than trying to make a list of every possible command.

The more examples you use to train the machine learning model, the better your program should get at recognising commands.
