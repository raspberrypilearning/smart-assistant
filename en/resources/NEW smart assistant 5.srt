1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,480
Go back to the 'Learn & Test' page.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,440
Type something that is not 
related to lamps or fans.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,240
The model should show a low 
confidence about its prediction.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,520
Go back to Scratch, and move all of 
your 'if' statements to one side.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,880
Add an 'if/else' so that your code can 
check the model's confidence level.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:36,640
The light or fan should only be changed 
if the confidence level is over 70.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Try it out!
