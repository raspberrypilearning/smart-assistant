## Introduction

In this project you will use [machinelearningforkids.co.uk](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk){:target="_blank"} to make a smart virtual classroom assistant that reacts to what you say to it. You’ll be able to control the virtual devices in the classroom by typing in commands!

First, you’ll create an assistant that uses a list of rules for understanding commands, and you'll learn why that approach isn’t very good.

Next, you will teach the assistant to recognise commands for different devices by training it using examples of each command.
