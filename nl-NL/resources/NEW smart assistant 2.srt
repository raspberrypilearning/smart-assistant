1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,080
Add two new labels

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
one for fan on,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,760
and one for fan off.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,200
Type an example of a command 
that should turn the fan on.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,240
Then repeat until you have 
eight different examples.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,960
Now you need eight different examples 
of commands to turn the fan off too.
