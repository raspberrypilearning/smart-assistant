Now that your model can distinguish between commands, you can use it in a Scratch program to create your smart assistant.

Machine Learning for Kids has added some special blocks to Scratch to allow you to use the model you just trained. Find them at the bottom of the blocks list.

- Right click on the `if` block and select **Duplicate** to add a copy of the whole block of code, and put it directly underneath the first `if`.

- Change the second copy of the block so that it recognises the text for turning the fan **off**, and broadcasts **turn-fan-off**.

- Click the **green flag** and type in a command to turn the fan on or off. Check that it has the result you expected.

- Make sure you test that the assistant performs the correct action **even for commands that you didnâ€™t include as examples**.
