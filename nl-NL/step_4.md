## Train the model

Now that you have some example data, you can train the machine learning model to label a command as either 'fan on' or 'fan off' based on your examples.

\--- task ---

- Klik op de link **< Terug naar project**.
  \--- /task ---

\--- task ---

- Klik op de knop **Train**.
  \--- /collapse --- --- /task ---

Wait for the training to complete — this might take a minute or two. Once the training has completed, a test box appears.

\--- task ---

- Type in `put the fan on` and check that the model labels this input as 'fan on'.

\--- task ---

- Try typing in some other commands for turning the fan on and off, and check that they are given the label you expect.

\--- /task ---

If you’re not happy with how the computer recognises the commands, go back to the previous step and add some more examples. Then **train new machine learning model** again.
