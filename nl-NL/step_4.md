## Collect examples for training

\--- task \---
+ Close the Scratch window and go back to the Training tool.

+ Click on the **< Back to project** link. \--- /task \---

\--- task \---
+ Click on the **Train** button. ![Project main menu](images/project-train-annotated.png)

You need to collect some examples to train the computer. To collect different examples, you need to create 'buckets' to put the examples in.

+ To create a bucket, click on **+ Add new label** and call the bucket “fan on”. Click on **+ Add new label** again and create a second bucket called “fan off”. Create a third and a fourth bucket called “lamp on” and "lamp off". ![4 empty classes named fan_on, fan_off, lamp_on and lamp_off](images/empty-buckets.png)

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “fan on” bucket, and type in a command asking for the fan to be turned on. For example, you could type “Please can you switch on the fan”.

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “fan off” bucket, and type in a command asking for the fan to be switched off. For example, you could type “I want the fan off now”.

+ Do the same for the “lamp on” and “lamp off” buckets.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---
+ Continue to **Add example**s until you have at least **six** examples in **each** bucket.

Be imaginative! Try and think of lots of different ways to ask each command. For example:

+ For “fan on”, you could complain that you’re too hot.
+ For “fan off”, you could complain that it’s too breezy.
+ For “lamp on”, you could complain that you can’t see.
+ For “lamp off”, you could complain that it’s too bright.

+ **More is good**: the more examples you give your program, the better the program should get at recognising your commands.

+ **Equal numbers**: add roughly the same number of examples for each command. If you have a lot of examples for one command and not the others, this can affect the way that the program learns to recognise commands.

+ **Make the examples really different from each other**: try to come up with lots of different types of examples. For example, make sure that you include some long examples and some very short ones.

In the next step you will train your program to recognise any new command automatically by comparing it to the examples in the four buckets.
